If no error raised: Try->Else->Finally
If error raised and exception captured : Try->Except->finally
If error raised and no exception captured: Try->Finally->Program crash
If error raised and exception captured and return statement in exception handler : Try->Exception block until return statement -> Finally ->return statement of exception handler. 

Why and When else and finally is used?

Lets understand this with an example...

Traditional Approach

try:
-- Open File 
-- Process File 
-- Display modified File
-- Close file object
except:
 -- Handle File Process Exceptions.
 -- close file object
 -- Exit current function


Better way of writing above code

try:
 -- Open file
 -- Process file
except:
 -- Handle File Processing Exceptions 
 -- Exit from current Function
else:
 -- Display Modified File
finally:
 -- Close file object
